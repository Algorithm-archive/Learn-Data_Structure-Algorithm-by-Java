# Bubble Sort

**Bubble Sort** is an algorithm which is used to sort **N** elements that are given in a memory for eg: an Array with N number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values.

It is called Bubble sort, because *with each iteration the smaller element in the list bubbles up towards the first place*, just like a water bubble rises up to the water surface.

Sorting takes place by stepping through all the data items one-by-one in pairs and comparing adjacent data items and swapping each pair that is out of order.
